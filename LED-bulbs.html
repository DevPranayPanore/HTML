    1906: Henry Joseph Round discovered the principle of electroluminescence, where a solid-state diode emits light when
    an electrical current passes through it.<br>
    1927: Oleg Losev, a Soviet inventor, created a silicon carbide LED.

<p>Introduction to LED (Light Emitting Diode) - The Engineering ...LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current flows through it. It's a highly energy-efficient and versatile technology used in various applications, from lighting to displays and sensors. 
</p>
<p>There are various types of LEDs, including:<br>
    High-Power LEDs: Designed for applications requiring high brightness, such as floodlights and spotlights. <br>
    RGB LEDs: Allow for a wide range of colors by combining red, green, and blue LEDs. <br>
    Chip-on-Board (COB) LEDs: High-power LEDs that are mounted directly onto a circuit board. </p><hr>

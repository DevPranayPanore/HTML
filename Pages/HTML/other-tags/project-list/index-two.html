            Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically
            associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and
            decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and
            software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take
            actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1]

            High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation
            systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and
            Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and
            superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not
            perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being
            called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."[2][3]

            Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically
            associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and
            decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and
            software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take
            actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1]

            High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation
            systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and
            Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and
            superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not
            perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being
            called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."[2][3]

            Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The
            traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural
            language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] To reach these goals, AI researchers have
            adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal
            logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b]
            AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[4] Some companies,
            such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)â€”AI that can
            complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.[5]

            Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through
            multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of
            funding, known as AI winters.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics
            processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous
            AI techniques.[11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture.[12] In the
            2020s, the period of rapid progress marked by advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative
            AI and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the
            present and raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting
            discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.

    <h1>
        Virat kohli
    </h1>
    <p>Virat Kohli (born November 5, 1988, Delhi, India) is an Indian international cricketer considered by many as one
        of the greatest batsmen in the history of the game. Kohli plays for (and previously captained) the Royal
        Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He is also a former captain of the Indian
        cricket team in all three international formats—Test cricket, one-day internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20
        internationals (T20I)—making him one of India's most successful captains.
        Kohli has earned praise for his discipline and commitment from teammates, opponents, and cricket veterans alike.
        “He has changed the face of cricket and how you prepare for the game. The discipline that he has stands out,
        always,” cricketing great Brian Lara said of Kohli after Kohli was named Player of the Tournament for the 2023
        Cricket World Cup.</p>
